It was downloaded from:

  Following discussion with the authors, an extra upstream release
  was specially prepared by the upstream authors, including the updated
  Readme and file headers covering its release into the public domain:

    This version of the Birmingham Cross-City South route has been
    specially prepared for inclusion with openBVE, and is released
    into the public domain. There are a few objects and sounds missing
    from this version, and it doesn't yet use all of openBVE's
    features as it's adapted from the BVE 4 version of the
    route--there wasn't time to update it with newer features sadly.

    This route has been released into the Public Domain, and you are
    free to do anything you like with the files. :)

    The decision to release the route free from restrictions was made
    as a result of my own changed attitudes towards copyright which,
    because of the way in which it is often used, doesn't help to
    bring about the kind of world I want to live in. I was also
    inspired by the remarkable attitude of openBVE's developer. In
    releasing this route into the public domain, I hope I can help to
    change the prevailing protective and copyright-focused attitude
    amongst many BVE developers, and foster a new era of free and
    harmonious sharing of creative works, without selfish
    restrictions.

    If you like any of my work and want to redistribute it, please
    feel free to let me know, but you don't have to. :)
