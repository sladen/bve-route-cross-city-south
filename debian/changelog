bve-route-cross-city-south (1.31.03-0ubuntu1) jaunty; urgency=low

  * This package can be modularised to produce multiple binary
    packages once the extent of overlap with other trains/route data
    is understood.
  * Initial release (LP: #331188) (LP: #356615)
  * Replace spaces in filenames with underscores
  * Set the suggested train to 'BR_Class_323' to match with where
    'bve-train-br-class-323' installs to.
  * Request lzma compression from dh_builddeb
  * Symlink duplicate models/textures together
  * Add a known-issues.txt file and add to docs.
  * Recode the huge .wav audio files to .ogg to save 90% size.
  * Rename source-package-name to match binary-package-name
  * Include pseudo 'watch' file
