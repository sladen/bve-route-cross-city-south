Unfixed:

1. Missing track panel just before reaching Bournville in summer+dry
routes; it is the junction point blades.

2. Birmingham city centre backgrounds were removed for this PD
release, so the whole route looks like it's in the countryside.

3. To correctly stop at the signal on the main line, you need to stop
about 150 metres in advance, but just before the signal.

4. The Timetable refer to 'F3/F4' to hide/show, but these are different
(and configurable) keys in OpenBVE.
