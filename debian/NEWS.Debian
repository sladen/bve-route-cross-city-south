openbve (1.31.08-0ubuntu1) maverick; urgency=low

  Now only the high-quality views of the sceanarios are shipped.  The
  choice of low-, medium- and high-quality graphics
  versions has been dropped.  This means that the route files can now
  be found one directory upwards compared to the previous locations.

  The keyboard instructions shown in the overlay timetables are
  corrected and match those used by Openbve.
