Thank you for downloading the Birmingham Cross-City South route, and I hope you enjoy using it with the wonderful openBVE simulator. The official openBVE homepage:

http://openbve.uuuq.com

This version of the Birmingham Cross-City South route has been specially prepared for inclusion with openBVE, and is released into the public domain. There are a few objects and sounds missing from this version, and it doesn't yet use all of openBVE's features as it's adapted from the BVE 4 version of the route--there wasn't time to update it with newer features sadly.

Cross-City South version 1.4 is being developed at the time of writing, which will showcase a variety of openBVE specific features, such as animated scenery and external car objects.

For more information, and to keep up-to-date with developments, please visit my website:

On my site there is also a Progress Updates section, where I post work-in-progress screenshots and videos:

This route has been released into the Public Domain, and you are free to do anything you like with the files. :)

The decision to release the route free from restrictions was made as a result of my own changed attitudes towards copyright which, because of the way in which it is often used, doesn't help to bring about the kind of world I want to live in. I was also inspired by the remarkable attitude of openBVE's developer. In releasing this route into the public domain, I hope I can help to change the prevailing protective and copyright-focused attitude amongst many BVE developers, and foster a new era of free and harmonious sharing of creative works, without selfish restrictions.

If you like any of my work and want to redistribute it, please feel free to let me know, but you don't have to. :)

Thanks in particular goes to the following people, without whom the Cross-City wouldn't have been nearly as detailed, accurate, complete or enjoyable to build:

Steve Green [www.trainsimcentral.co.uk]:

For supplying invaluable route data, offering useful feedback on the accuracy of the route, for his work on the new Class 323 for BVE v4, and of course for his extensive route testing and expertise.

Simon Gathercole:

For assisting with the development of the DirectX objects using emissive properties to create realistic night lighting. Also for his amazing work developing the plugin Dynamic Link Library, giving a host of functions to the BVE 4 class 323 EMU.

Robert Glass [http://scotrailsim.co.uk]:

For conducting extensive testing of the route on several occasions, providing extra inspiration and feedback where various aspects of the route are concerned; for giving me the idea for using CSV Cylinder commands to re-create more realistic headlight effects, for assisting with the maths involved in creating the "smooth curves", for allowing me to use and adapt his "Falling Snow" objects from his excellent Sandymill to Invermay Seasonal Special.

Stephen Cross [http://ozrail.cjb.net]:

Rich Haywood:

For being extremely helpful during the Beta testing, and for taking the time to send thorough feedback.
